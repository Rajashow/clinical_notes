new_bert/train\248-01.xml,93,Danny Nielson is a 76 - year - old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital .,O
new_bert/train\248-01.xml,94,This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma .,O
new_bert/train\248-01.xml,95,I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son .,O
new_bert/train\248-01.xml,96,I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable .,O

new_bert/train\292-04.xml,3,"As you are well aware , he has many coronary risk factors .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,4,"He is a 55 - year - old gentleman with past history Hodgkin ' s disease , status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT / VF arrest .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,5,"He has history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , as well as overweight .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,6,"He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes , but on recent screening , his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8 % .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,7,His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non - ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,8,"He has subsequently had a VT / VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094 , which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,9,He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,10,"In 01 / 2095 , he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina , presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions , both which were intervened with drug - eluting Cypher stents with good results .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,11,"Since then , he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p . o .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,12,daily lifelong .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,13,"We see him in followup today , and again , he has no limitations in his exertional capacity .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,14,"Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts , which is strenuous at times .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,15,He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job .,O

new_bert/train\292-04.xml,46,"Mild left atrial enlargement , no LVH .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,47,"Impression : Nick is still borderline hypertensive , and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions , Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic , I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,48,We started him on ramipril 2 . 5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,49,He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,50,To simplify and decrease his beta - blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,51,We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,52,He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects .,O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,53,"With regards to his coronary artery disease , all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,54,"Nevertheless , Dr .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,55,"Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition , given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,56,"The results may not changes our current management strategy , but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology , particularly coronary artery thrombus , as well as play a future role in familial screening .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,57,"To that end , we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition .",O
new_bert/train\292-04.xml,58,"We have also requested a thrombophilia workup , including factor V Leiden , prothrombin gene mutation , protein C and S levels , antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today .",O

new_bert/train\292-05.xml,4,"He received bare - metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma , his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI / VT / VF arrest .",O
new_bert/train\292-05.xml,5,"Immediate angiography post - resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery , with good result after thrombectomy and POBA , in addition to Integrilin , aspirin , Plavix , and low dose heparin .",O
new_bert/train\292-05.xml,6,"Remarkably , after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event .",O
new_bert/train\292-05.xml,7,He did well until 01 / 2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in - stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare - metal stents .,O
new_bert/train\292-05.xml,8,He was treated with Cypher drug - eluting stents to both lesions ( 3 . 5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3 . 5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA ) with no residual stenosis .,O
new_bert/train\292-05.xml,9,Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in - stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy ( 325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg ) since that event intended as longterm therapy .,O

new_bert/train\299-04.xml,32,IMPRESSION : Progressive renal failure in a 74 - year - old woman with more than 10 years ' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,33,"The proteinuria , if confirmed , would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but this would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,34,It would be useful to know from her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,35,"It is , of course , also possible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,36,Their symmetry and the presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,37,The ACE inhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum creatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,38,Her loss of appetite and nausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,39,"RECOMMENDATION : I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia , RD , a renal dietitian , to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and hyperlipidemia .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,40,This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,41,It think it would be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and perhaps her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with less ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,42,"If , of course , shortness of breath worsens or edema appears , then returning to the Lasix would be reasonable .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,43,"It might be that a longer acting , milder diuretic , such as 5 mg of metolazone might help to control edema ( and potassium ) and reduce the requirement for Lasix .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,44,"If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and diuresis , it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural , and it might be then possible to return to these medicines with less worry .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,45,Her anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit from instituting therapy with Epogen ( such as 4000 units twice a week ) or Aranesp ) .,O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,46,"PLAN : We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio , which may help us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,47,"If so , the measures proposed would be appropriate .",O
new_bert/train\299-04.xml,48,We discussed the eventual probable need for dialysis ( assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes ) .,O

new_bert/train\303-03.xml,92,"This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume , thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia , and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications , thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,93,"Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances , infections , drug toxicity , metabolic disorders , low perfusion states , withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives , and idiopathic .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,94,"In addition , there is the possibility of CVA , however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,95,Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia .,O

new_bert/train\303-03.xml,98,"Her BUN is elevated at 77 , which is close to twice her baseline , and in the setting of a fragile patient , this could be enough to tip her over to delirium .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,99,"Her glucose was 215 on admission , which is elevated , but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,100,Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12 . 1 with 78 % poly ' s .,O

new_bert/train\303-03.xml,104,"Her mental status change could be drug induced , as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,105,"Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption , although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,106,"However , cardiovascular drugs , antidepressants , and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them , including two SSRI ' s .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,107,"The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion , and by inducing more diuresis , it can cause a prerenal state , thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels , thus leading to delirium .",O
new_bert/train\303-03.xml,108,"Indeed , her baseline Creatinine is from 1 . 6 - 1 . 9 and was 2 . 4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20 - 40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED .",O

new_bert/train\334-02.xml,6,"Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm , as you know .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,7,He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,8,During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,9,He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,10,He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,11,Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,12,In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,13,"The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first , second and third toes .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,14,He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,15,He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,16,"He has no evidence of fevers , chills , rigors or shakes in the interim .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,17,He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,18,His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,19,He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,20,On exam today he is doing quite well .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,21,He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,22,His head and neck exams were unremarkable .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,23,His lungs were clear .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,24,Heart was regular .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,25,"His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely , however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,26,With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,27,"There is no evidence of cellulitis , induration or infection of the right lower extremity .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,28,He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,29,"Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today , which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,30,He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,31,This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,32,"His left calf , ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,33,"In summary , this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,34,He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,35,"Given this concern , I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb - threatening gangrene of the left .",O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,36,With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re - evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter .,O
new_bert/train\334-02.xml,37,I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes .,O

new_bert/train\335-02.xml,86,"Since syphilis , too , could cause noncaseating granulomas , and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated , this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis .",O

new_bert/train\335-02.xml,88,She had CSF pleocytosis in July .,O

new_bert/train\335-02.xml,92,"If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis , then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course , her CSF , and her syphilis serologies .",O

new_bert/train\335-02.xml,95,"She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke , but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis , we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this .",O
new_bert/train\335-02.xml,96,I would recommend treatment now with a 14 - day course of high - dose ( 20 - 24 million units a day ) penicillin .,O
new_bert/train\335-02.xml,97,She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch - Herxheimer reaction .,O
new_bert/train\335-02.xml,98,"I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy , then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone , to follow her clinically and with repeated LP , and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course .",O

new_bert/train\364-03.xml,31,The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,32,The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,33,The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,34,"It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0 , in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds .",O

new_bert/train\364-03.xml,37,In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,38,Due to the patient ' s size it was difficult to identify perforators .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,39,"In summary , we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration .",O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,40,Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,41,I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,42,Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,43,"This in addition to his morbid obesity , that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day , seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs .",O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,44,"All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration , ulceration and lower extremity swelling .",O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,45,The solution to this problem is not an easy one .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,46,With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,47,"Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs , however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device .",O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,48,If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long - term benefit .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,49,I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,50,I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,51,"I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care , which are important .",O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,52,I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling .,O
new_bert/train\364-03.xml,53,It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth .,O
