new_bert/test\131-05.xml,58,He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura .,O

new_bert/test\131-05.xml,71,Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization .,O

new_bert/test\138-04.xml,6,"It appears that she had been having a several - month history of anginal - type symptoms , although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia .",O

new_bert/test\138-04.xml,8,She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,9,I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3 . 5 x 23 and 3 . 5 x 13 Cypher drug - eluting stents to the right coronary artery .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,10,"Per her daughter ' s report , she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel , which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,11,"Unfortunately , we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy .",O

new_bert/test\138-04.xml,46,She has only mild mitral regurgitation .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,47,"In summary , well we do not have records , it is fairly clear that Mrs .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,48,Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,49,She did receive drug - eluting stents .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,50,The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,51,"What is less clear , however , is the status of her other coronaries , there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,52,"From a clinical standpoint , I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,53,"She is fairly asymptomatic , and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,54,I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,55,"To this end , I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,56,We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,57,"In terms of her lipids , it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,58,The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,59,"In terms of antithrombotic therapy , she did receive drug - eluting stents .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,60,"Therefore , she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,61,"After a year , it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,62,"However , up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,63,"She is on a very good medical regimen , although I think she would benefit from a beta - blocker .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,64,"The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her , and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended - release metoprolol at 25 mg a day .",O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,65,This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control .,O
new_bert/test\138-04.xml,66,"I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations , and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months .",O

new_bert/test\138-05.xml,7,This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms .,O
new_bert/test\138-05.xml,8,We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3 . 5 x 24 Taxus drug - eluting stent .,O
new_bert/test\138-05.xml,9,The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure .,O
new_bert/test\138-05.xml,10,The final angiographic result was excellent .,O

new_bert/test\166-01.xml,43,Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer .,O
new_bert/test\166-01.xml,44,"I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him , which is a shame , as that was his preference .",O

new_bert/test\166-01.xml,46,His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment .,O
new_bert/test\166-01.xml,47,"On balance , my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy , perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively , if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does , for him to have high - dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation .",O
new_bert/test\166-01.xml,48,While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this .,O

new_bert/test\197-01.xml,6,Emery is a 86 - year - old right - handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,7,His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,8,This had extended over several months to include his feet as well .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,9,"Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally , which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,10,At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,11,Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,12,"He has had no falls , but does note some unsteadiness on his feet .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,13,He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,14,"He has had no diplopia , dysarthria , dysphagia , or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to neurologic problems .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,15,He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,16,"Otherwise , the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,17,"Past medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones , history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non - Hodgkins .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,18,He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,19,"He has a history of prostate hypertrophy , hypertension , and longstanding history of noninsulin - dependent diabetes since the age of 50 .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,20,His glucose control by his history has been very good .,O

new_bert/test\197-01.xml,25,His family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,26,He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection .,O

new_bert/test\197-01.xml,28,"On my examination today , he is alert and well appearing , with good concentration , memory , and language function .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,29,No carotid bruits could be appreciated .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,30,The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,31,"He had full extraocular motility , with normal visual fields bilaterally .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,32,Funduscopy was normal bilaterally .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,33,Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,34,"The muscles of facial expression , mastication , and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,35,Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,36,"On motor examination , occasional fasciculations were seen throughout .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,37,"There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally , and trace weakness at IV + / V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,38,"Otherwise , muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle , forearm , and upper arm were V / V bilaterally .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,39,"In the lower extremities , again , distal muscle wasting was noted , although power in all muscle groups was full .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,40,Sensation testing revealed a moderate - to - severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,41,"Temperature , pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,42,"There was no dysmetria on finger - nose - finger testing , and gait was not ataxic .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,43,Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,44,Deep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,45,"Specifically I + reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution , trace ankle jerks were elicited , and I + reflexes were elicited in the biceps , triceps , and brachioradialis .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,46,There was no jaw jerk .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,47,Toes were downgoing bilaterally .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,48,Mr .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,49,Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,50,Those results were available for me today .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,51,"They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy , which is moderate in distal extremities .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,52,Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,53,"There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype , and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist , consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,54,Given the apparent chronic nature of Mr .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,55,"Emery ' s complaints , an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin , or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,56,"With respect to the weakness in the hands , which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist , this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,57,"There is no abnormality on the history , examination , or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,58,"In addition to the diabetes , of course the primary concern would be lymphoma - related neuropathy , either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium , or more often as a perineoplastic phenomenon .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,59,"The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology , and he is , of course , undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,60,I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of his illness .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,61,"Unfortunately , as you know , we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,62,"We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline , Gabapentin , or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____ .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,63,"However , this is not a prominent complaint of Mr .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,64,Emery ' s and this is not likely to be helpful for him .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,65,"Nevertheless , there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem .",O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,66,I will be happy to continue to see Mr .,O
new_bert/test\197-01.xml,67,"Emery on a roughly yearly basis , so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future .",O

new_bert/test\209-01.xml,75,I hope that this will be the case .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,76,"Unfortunately , his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement .",O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,77,I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,78,His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,79,"I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled , as has been done , and to continue an anticholesterol agent .",O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,80,I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,81,The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,82,I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,83,"However , since he has been on this medicine so long , it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well .",O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,84,He should continue on an aspirin a day .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,85,He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,86,"I recommended to him that , in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care , patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type .",O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,87,We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,88,This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,89,"After six months , if he has had no further clinical events , it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin .",O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,90,I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months .,O
new_bert/test\209-01.xml,91,I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year ' s time .,O

new_bert/test\211-02.xml,4,"As you know , Mr .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,5,"Urban is a very pleasant 50 - year - old gentleman who on July 09 , 2093 , while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling unwell , epigastric discomfort , and profound diaphoresis .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,6,He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,7,"By the time he arrived , his symptoms had abated .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,8,"He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers , and was admitted to the medicine service to rule - out a myocardial infarction .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,9,"That evening , he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia , which appears to be ventricular tachycardia .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,10,He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,11,"The next morning , he underwent cardiac ultrasound , which revealed an ejection fraction of 28 % and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,12,Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,13,He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non - obstructive disease of the left system .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,14,"This artery was stented with total of three stents ( two Express stents 2 . 5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2 . 5 x 28 mm ) , encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,15,A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30 % with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,16,He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2 . 0 .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,17,"A follow - up echocardiogram was performed on July 15 , 2093 .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,18,This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36 % ; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,19,His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,20,"Because of this , a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies , normal thyroid function , and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,21,He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient .,O

new_bert/test\211-02.xml,49,"His chest is clear to auscultation without rales , wheezes , or rhonchi .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,50,His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2 .,O

new_bert/test\211-02.xml,63,Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,64,"He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS , and a peak double product of 21 , 600 .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,65,His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,66,His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,67,There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,68,His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51 % .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,69,"In short , Mr .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,70,"Urban is a 51 - year - old who had an inferior myocardial infarction , but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,71,"Also , his systolic function has improved over time .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,72,I think there are two processes going on .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,73,One is coronary artery disease .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,74,"Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery , which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,75,The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,76,"Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction , I can only speculate as to the etiology of this .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,77,"He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy , but a transient one .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,78,I suspect that this is myocarditis .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,79,"Unfortunatley , I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,80,It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,81,"From the aspect of his coronary artery disease , he will continue on aspirin for life .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,82,"He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery , and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,83,"For his hyperlipidemia , I agree with Lipitor , and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,84,His LDL goal will be less than 100 .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,85,"He is well beta - blocked on his carvedilol , and we will continue with the current dose of 6 . 25 mg twice daily .",O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,86,His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,87,I will see Mr .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,88,Urban again in three months for followup .,O
new_bert/test\211-02.xml,89,I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months ' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out .,O

new_bert/test\211-03.xml,27,Impression : This is a 50 year - old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093 .,O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,28,"Additionally , he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,29,He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction .,O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,30,"Notably , his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,31,The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear .,O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,32,There is likely a component of left heart failure .,O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,33,"In addition , he may have right heart failure out - of - proportion to left heart failure : he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and , lastly , he may have obstructive sleep apnea .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,34,"He reports to me that he does snore at night , and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,35,This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration .,O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,36,"Recommendations : Initially , I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,37,"The rest of his regimen is quite good , and I intend to continue them .",O
new_bert/test\211-03.xml,38,"To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this , I am going to obtain first a chest x - ray , secondly a pulmonary function testing , and lastly a sleep study .",O

new_bert/test\237-02.xml,12,The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight .,O

new_bert/test\237-02.xml,22,"It has been 11 years since his bypass operation , and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia .",O
new_bert/test\237-02.xml,23,"While this might be controversial , as to whether to do a stress test or not , my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease .",O

new_bert/test\349-01.xml,4,"In February , she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning .",O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,5,There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,6,"This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion , she fell getting out of bed .",O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,7,The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,8,"She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected , she feels that the event has not re - occured .",O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,9,The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well .,O

new_bert/test\349-01.xml,11,The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,12,Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,13,"Also , in the record is noted that at the time of the second event , her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50 .",O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,14,There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,15,"On examination at the time of admission , there were no clear findings .",O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,16,MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,17,The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage .,O

new_bert/test\349-01.xml,21,It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,22,Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA .,O
new_bert/test\349-01.xml,23,Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor .,O

new_bert/test\349-01.xml,71,Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature .,O

new_bert/test\349-01.xml,75,She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure .,O

new_bert/test\377-01.xml,3,Quick ATCH : 655 - 75 - 45 Dear Harry and Yair : My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,4,"As you know , she is just 52 years of age .",O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,5,"Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year .",SMOKER-PAST
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,6,She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,7,She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,8,She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,9,On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem - pop bypass graft .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,10,"This reconstruction is functioning well , as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side .",O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,11,In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem - pop bypass graft to the above - knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,12,There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,13,She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,14,"By last spring , i . e .",O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,15,a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,16,She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,17,Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,18,Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0 . 46 on the right and 0 . 8 on the left .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,19,Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion ( ? ? ? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves ) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above - knee popliteal artery with decent runoff .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,20,Understandably Dr .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,21,Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,22,She has sought an opinion here in this regard .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,23,She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,24,On physical examination blood pressure was 140 / 80 .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,25,Pulse was 70 and regular .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,26,Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,27,"She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem - pop bypass graft in situ is palpable , as is the left popliteal pulse .",O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,28,There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,29,She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,30,This is of course a very unhappy situation .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,31,Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,32,However I am not absolutely ruling this out .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,33,I would suggest the following .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,34,"Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor , aspirin and Plavix .",O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,35,Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,36,She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,37,If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,38,I will get back to you after review of the films themselves .,O
new_bert/test\377-01.xml,39,My thanks once again .,O
